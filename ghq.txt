get::

list::

    repositories whose names contain that query text are listed. '-e'
    ('--exact') forces the match to be an exact one (i.e. the query equals to
    _repo_ or _user_/_repo_) If '-p' is given, the full paths to
    the repository root are printed instead of relative ones.

    performs 'get' for each of them.
